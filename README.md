My Favorite Series is probably **Chūnibyō Demo Koi ga Shitai!** it is an animated series about the main character who
abandon his Chunibyo syndrome when he got into highschool and the girl who got inspired by him on being a chunibyo until they meet each other
and formed a heartwarming and fun romantic comedy series :heart:
